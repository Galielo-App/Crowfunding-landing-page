### What I learned

Hey guys!

This was a good one, the javascript part of the project to make everything interactive was hard, i need to admit! In the middle of the project i switched from objected oriented with classes to functional programming with pure functions. I clearly used the wrong programming pattern at the beginning, im not gonna use POO on something like this again.

Im still testing everything to make sure that everything works properly and there are no issues or bugs. So if you guys found a bug, please make sure to report!

But overall, i did a pretty good job with js. Probably i'm going to refactor a few things in the future but for now I'm ok with the result.
